## 📄 Description
The Body Mass Index (BMI) Calculator is a tool that helps estimate an individual's body fat based on their height and weight. This project includes a simple application that calculates BMI and provides a health categorization based on the calculated value.

## 📊 BMI Formula
The formula used to calculate BMI is:
\[ \text{BMI} = \frac{\text{Weight (kg)}}{\text{Height (m)}^2} \]

Alternatively, for height in inches and weight in pounds:
\[ \text{BMI} = \frac{\text{Weight (lb)} \times 703}{\text{Height (in)}^2} \]

## ⚙️ Functionality
- **Input**: Users input their weight and height.
- **Calculate**: On pressing the "Calculate BMI" button, the application computes the BMI value.

  - Underweight
  - Normal weight
  - Overweight
  - Obese
